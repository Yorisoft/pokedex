This app was made from scratch for the MiyooMini devices. The goal is to design it to target gens 1 - 5 to help you track down all your favorite Pokemon and have all their information at your finger tips :) 

### PLEASE READ! This is not yet stable - this is a work in progress - there are bugs - install at your own peril.

## Installation

### Transferring the App to the Miyoo Mini Device

1. Connect the Miyoo Mini device to your computer.
  - Refer to the OnionOS wiki for the various ways to do this, e.g., FTP, Webserver, Samba, etcâ€¦
2. Transfer the `Pokedex` folder found in the `App` directory of this repo to the device. Place the `Pokedex` folder in `/mnt/SDCARD/App` folder of the miyoo mini.
3. On the miyoo mini device, navigate to your Apps list. Refresh your App list by bringing up and exiting the 'search' function - pressing `x`
4. Navigate to the HelloMiyoo app and launch it.

## Compiling and Building

### Compiling on Windows Visual Studio

1. Open the `Pokedex` folder located in the `Source/windows-visual-studio` directory. In there you will find a project solution for opening in Visual Studios. 
2. Configure Visual Studios with SDL and SDL_ttf libraries and include directories.
3. Compile and run the program.

</br>

### Compiling on Union-miyoomini-toolchain

1. Clone and start the docker container for the union-miyoomini-toolchain. 
   - Read the `README.md` located in the `Source/union-miyoomini-toolchain` directory for instructions on how to get started with union-miyoomini-toolchain, or refer to their GitHub README. 
   - [union-miyoomini-toolchain](https://github.com/MiyooMini/union-toolchain/tree/main)
2. Transfer the contents `workspace` folder from the `Source/union-miyoomini-toolchain` directory of this repo to the development environment `/workspace`. 
   - Optionally you could just replace the `workspace` folder with the one from this repo. 
3. Compile the Pokedex program using the provided CMakeList and Toolchain files:
     ```
        cd build
        cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../Toolchain.cmake
        make
     ```
4. The binary should be located in `workspace/build/` </br>
     `Pokedex DownloadIcons DownloadSprites DownloadAnimatedSprites`
5. Download artwork by running:
```
./DownloadIcons ./DownloadSprites ./DownloadAnimatedSprites
```
