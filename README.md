# Pokedex for Miyoo Mini!

This app was made from scratch using for the MiyooMini devices. The goal is to design it to target gens 1 - 5 to help you track down all your favorite Pokemon and have all their information at your finger tips :) 

## Current Status

The app is currently in the early stages. At the moment, it only contains the Pokedex list with minimal stats. The next step is to work on the species dex entry.

## Data and Assets

I designed it using CPP, SDL, and SQLite.

Dataset from Veekun

Artwork from pokemondb.net.

## Installation and Building
